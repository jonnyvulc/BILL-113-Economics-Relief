[Approved by Governor February 9, 2022. Filed with Secretary
of State February 9, 2022.]
legislative counsel’s digest
SB 113, Committee on Budget and Fiscal Review. Economic relief:
COVID-19 pandemic.
(1) Existing law, the California Emergency Services Act, authorizes the
Governor to proclaim a state of emergency when specified conditions of
disaster or extreme peril to the safety of persons and property exist, and
authorizes the Governor to exercise certain powers in response to that
emergency, including, but not limited to, making expenditures from any
fund legally available in order to deal with actual or threatened conditions
of the state of emergency.
On March 4, 2020, the Governor proclaimed a state of emergency in
response to the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic.
Pursuant to specified provisions relating to the prevention and control of
communicable diseases, the State Public Health Officer ordered all
individuals living in the state to stay home or at their place of residence
except as needed to maintain continuity of operations of the federal critical
infrastructure sectors, as specified. Pursuant to authority under specified
provisions of the California Emergency Services Act, the Governor issued
Executive Order No. N-33-20 requiring all residents to immediately heed
those state public health directives.
Existing law, the California Small Business COVID-19 Relief Grant
Program, requires the Office of Small Business Advocate within the
Governor’s Office of Business and Economic Development to allocate
grants to qualified small businesses affected by COVID-19 and the related
health and safety restrictions, such as business interruptions or business
closures incurred as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, in accordance with
specified criteria.
This bill would create the California Emergency Relief Fund as a special
fund in the State Treasury to provide emergency resources or relief relating
96
to state of emergency declarations proclaimed by the Governor. The bill
would transfer from the General Fund to the California Emergency Relief
Fund $150,000,000 for purposes relating to the COVID-19 emergency
proclaimed by the Governor on March 4, 2020. The bill would appropriate
$150,000,000 from that fund to the Office of Small Business Advocate for
a closed round to fund small business grant applications waitlisted from
previous rounds of the California Small Business COVID-19 Relief Grant
Program.
(2) Existing law establishes the Water and Wastewater System Payments
Under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 and creates the California
Water and Wastewater Arrearage Payment Program for administration by
the State Water Resources Control Board upon appropriation, as specified.
Existing law authorizes community water systems to apply for program
funds to assist customers who have past-due bills from the COVID-19
pandemic bill relief period, as defined. Existing law requires community
water systems to allocate payments received under the program as bill credits
to customers, as provided, to help address past-due bills incurred during the
COVID-19 pandemic bill relief period. If there are sufficient funds
appropriated for purposes of the program, existing law requires the state
board to use the remaining funds to establish a similar program for funding
wastewater treatment provider arrearages and shortfalls.
Existing law also establishes within the Department of Community
Services and Development the California Arrearage Payment Program
(CAPP) under which specified electric and gas utilities are authorized to
apply for CAPP funds, on behalf of their customers in arrears, and requires
the utility to use any funds received, as specified, to offset customer
arrearages that were incurred during the COVID-19 pandemic bill relief
period, as defined. Existing law prohibits service from being discontinued
due to nonpayment for those customers included in a utility’s CAPP
application while the department reviews and approves all pending CAPP
applications, and requires the utility applicant to waive any associated late
fees and accrued interest for customers who are awarded CAPP benefits.
Existing law requires the utility applicant to issue CAPP benefits to
customers as bill credits to help address the eligible past due balance.
Existing law requires the department to report specified data to the
Legislature and on its public-facing internet website relating to distribution
of CAPP benefits.
This bill would require that any assistance or relief authorized by, and
provided by a community water system, a wastewater treatment provider,
or a utility applicant to an individual pursuant to, those acts be treated in
the same manner as the federal earned income refund for purposes of
determining the individual’s eligibility to receive benefits under specified
public social services laws. The bill would also prohibit any assistance or
relief from being taken into account as income, or as resources for a period
of 12 months from receipt, for purposes of determining the eligibility of the
individual, or any other individual, for benefits or assistance for any other
state or local program, as provided.

Ch. 3
The Personal Income Tax Law and the Corporation Tax Law, in
conformity with federal income tax law, generally define “gross income”
as income from whatever source derived, and provide various exclusions
from gross income.
This bill, for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2021, and
before January 1, 2026, would exclude from gross income any amount of
bill credits received by a customer from a community water system,
wastewater treatment provider, or utility applicant pursuant to those acts.
The bill would repeal these provisions on December 1, 2026.
(3) The Sales and Use Tax Law, in lieu of specified credits allowed under
the Personal Income Tax Law and the Corporation Tax Law for qualified
expenditures paid or incurred by a taxpayer for the production of a qualified
motion picture, allows a qualified taxpayer or affiliate to make an irrevocable
election to (A) claim a refund of qualified sales and use taxes previously
paid during a specified period not exceeding the income tax credit amount
and (B) apply that income tax credit amount against qualified sales and use
taxes imposed on the qualified taxpayer in the reporting periods in the 5
years following the reporting period for which the claimant was required
to file its most recent sales and use tax return, as specified. Existing law
prohibits the total amount of refunds or credit offsets claimed in lieu of
qualified motion picture tax credits that would otherwise be allowed for a
taxable year beginning on or after January 1, 2020, and before January 1,
2023, from exceeding $5,000,000.
This bill would limit this prohibition to taxable years beginning on or
after January 1, 2020, and before January 1, 2022.
Existing law provides that, for taxable years beginning on or after January
1, 2020, and before January 1, 2023, for those amounts that are in excess
of $5,000,000 for that taxable year, the claimant may offset that excess
credit amount, or assigned portion, against the qualified sales and use taxes
imposed during the reporting periods in the 5 years following and including
the reporting period beginning on and after January 1, 2024.
This bill would limit these provisions to taxable years beginning on or
after January 1, 2020, and before January 1, 2022, and would instead provide
that, for those amounts in excess of $5,000,000, the claimant may (i) elect
to obtain a refund, subject to specified limitations, of the qualified sales and
use taxes paid or offset that excess credit amount, or assigned portion against
the qualified sales and use taxes imposed, during the reporting periods that
occur during the 2021 calendar year or (ii) the claimant may offset the
remaining excess credit amount, or assigned portion, against the qualified
sales and use taxes imposed during the reporting periods in the 5 years
following and including the reporting period beginning on and after January
1, 2022, as specified.
(4) Existing state constitutional law governing insurance taxation imposes
an annual tax on the gross premiums of an insurer, as defined, doing business
in this state at specified rates. Existing law governing the taxation of insurers
allows as credits against the taxes imposed by those laws a low-income
housing tax credit allocated by the California Tax Credit Allocation
96
Ch. 3 — 3 —
Committee, a College Access Tax Credit allocated and certified by the
California Educational Facilities Authority, and a credit in an amount equal
to the amount of the gross premiums tax due from an insurer on account of
pilot project insurance for previously uninsured motorists, as defined.
Existing law allows any excess low-income housing tax credit and College
Access Tax Credit to be carried over to reduce the tax in a succeeding year,
as specified.
Existing law provides that, for the years 2020, 2021, and 2022, the total
amount of College Access Tax Credits and uninsured motorist tax credits
otherwise allowable, including any credit amount allowed to be carried over
to reduce tax in the following year, shall not reduce the annual tax by more
than $5,000,000 for a given year.
This bill would, instead, provide that the above $5,000,000 cap applies
only to the years 2020 and 2021.
(5) The Personal Income Tax Law and the Corporation Tax Law, in
conformity with federal income tax law, generally define “gross income”
as income from whatever source derived, and provide various exclusions
from gross income. Existing law reduces the amount of any credit or
deduction otherwise allowed under the Personal Income Tax and the
Corporation Tax Law for any amount paid or incurred by the taxpayer upon
which this exclusion is based by the amount of the exclusion allowed.
Existing federal law, the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, awards
restaurant revitalization grants to eligible entities, including restaurants,
food stands, food trucks, bars, and brewpubs, who meet specified
requirements beginning on and after February 1, 2020. Existing federal law
excludes from gross income for purposes of federal income taxes any amount
received in the form of a restaurant revitalization grant, as specified. Existing
federal law prohibits reductions in tax deductions, reductions in tax attributes,
and denials of basis adjustments, for federal income tax purposes based on
that exclusion.
This bill, in modified conformity with federal law, would exclude, for
taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2020, from gross income any
amount received in the form of a federal restaurant revitalization grant. The
bill would adopt, except as provided, the provisions of the American Rescue
Plan Act of 2021 prohibiting any reduction in tax deductions, reductions in
tax attributes, and denials of basis adjustments based on the exclusion from
gross income.
Existing federal law, the Hard-Hit Small Businesses, Nonprofits, and
Venues Act, among other things, awards grants to eligible shuttered venue
operators, including live venue operators or promoters, theatrical producers,
and live performing arts organization operators. Existing federal law excludes
from gross income for purposes of federal income taxes any amount received
in the form of a shuttered venue operator grant, as specified. Existing federal
law prohibits reductions in tax deductions, reductions in tax attributes, and
denials of basis adjustments, for federal income tax purposes based on that
exclusion.
96
— 4 —
Ch. 3
This bill, for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2019, and in
conformity with federal law, would exclude from gross income any amount
received in the form of a federal shuttered venue operator grant. The bill
would adopt, except as provided, the provisions of the federal Consolidated
Appropriations Act, 2021, prohibiting any reduction in tax deductions,
reductions in tax attributes, and denials of basis adjustments based on the
exclusion from gross income, as provided.
(6) The Personal Income Tax Law and Corporation Tax Law, in modified
conformity with federal income tax laws, generally allow various deductions
in computing the income that is subject to taxes imposed by those laws,
including a deduction for a net operating loss as specified. Existing law
suspends the deduction for a net operating loss, as specified, for taxable
years beginning on or after January 1, 2020, and before January 1, 2023.
The Personal Income Tax Law and Corporation Tax Law generally
authorize various credits against the taxes imposed by those laws. Existing
law provides that, except as specified, the total credits allowable under those
laws may not reduce the taxes imposed by those laws by more than
$5,000,000, as provided, for taxable years beginning on or after January 1,
2020, and before January 1, 2023.
This bill would reinstate the net operating loss deduction, and would
remove the above-described temporary limitation on allowable credits, for
taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2022.
(7) Existing law, the Small Business Relief Act, authorizes specified
partnerships and “S” corporations, for taxable years beginning on or after
January 1, 2021, and before January 1, 2026, to elect to pay an elective tax
at a rate based on its net income, as specified, for the taxable year. The act,
for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2021, and before January
1, 2026, allows a credit against the personal income tax to a taxpayer, other
than a partnership, that is a partner, shareholder, or member of an entity that
elects to pay the elective tax, in an amount equal to a specified percentage
of the partner’s, shareholder’s, or member’s pro rata share or distributive
share, as applicable, of income subject to the elective tax paid by the entity.
The act defines a qualified entity for these purposes as an entity that is taxed
as a partnership or “S” corporation with partners, shareholders, or members
that are corporations or taxpayers, but not partnerships. The act excludes a
business entity that is disregarded for federal tax purposes from the definition
of taxpayer, and defines qualified net income as the sum of the pro rata
share or distributive share of income subject to tax under the Personal Income
Tax Law, as specified.
This bill, for purposes of the Small Business Relief Act, would include
a partnership as an eligible partner, shareholder, or member for purposes
of a qualified entity, and would include a limited liability company that is
disregarded for federal tax purposes and meets specified criteria in the
definition of a qualified taxpayer. The bill would also include specified
guaranteed payments as qualified net income for purposes of the act.
The Personal Income Tax Law provides for an alternative minimum tax
and provides that, except for specified credits, no credit shall reduce the
96
Ch. 3 — 5 —
regular tax, as defined, below the tentative minimum tax. Existing law also
requires credits allowed against the net tax to be applied in a specified order,
including applying credits that reduce the regular tax below the tentative
minimum tax before credits for taxes paid to other states.
This bill, for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2021, would
allow the elective tax credit to reduce the regular tax below the tentative
minimum tax. The bill, for taxable years beginning on or after January 1,
2022, would require the elective tax credit to be applied against the net tax
after credits for taxes paid to other states.
(8) Existing law requires any bill authorizing a new tax expenditure to
contain, among other things, specific goals, purposes, and objectives that
the tax expenditure will achieve, detailed performance indicators, and data
collection requirements.
This bill, for specified provisions, would provide findings to comply with
the additional information requirement for any bill authorizing a new tax
expenditure.
(9) This bill would also make findings and declarations related to a gift
of public funds.
(10) This bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as a bill
providing for appropriations related to the Budget Bill.
Appropriation: yes.
